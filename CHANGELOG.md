MapPinEnhanced has been completely rewritten from the ground up, allowing for easier addition of new features in the future. Additionally, nearly all components are now built with custom-made textures specifically created for this addon (special thanks to @Relts ❤️).

If you encounter any issues, problems, or bugs, I would greatly appreciate your feedback.
